Kyiv authorities announced on April 26 an urgent evacuation of two hospitals, including a children's one, saying that they were at a risk of being targeted in an air attack.

The two hospitals are located on Bohatyrska Street in the capital's northern Obolon district, according to the statement.

Kyiv authorities said there was no military personnel in the hospital.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) called Tertel's claims "a manifestation of psychological operations that play into the hands of Russia."

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko posted a video on Telegram showing the undergoing evacuation from hospitals "to protect children, their parents, adult patients and staff from a possible attack on these medical facilities."

"There is no evidence to suggest that Russia is actually going to launch such strikes so far," Kyiv City Military Administration head Serhiy Popko said.
