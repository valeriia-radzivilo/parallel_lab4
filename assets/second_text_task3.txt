Ask any of our students where a tourist should eat when they visit Kyiv and their suggestion is unanimous: Puzata Hata. The name means ‘fat house’ and it is basically Ukrainian style fast food. Puzata Hata is a buffet-style restaurant, which makes it perfect for tourists who can’t speak any Ukrainian. You just go the counter, look at the food on offer and point to what you want. In a canteen style, you join the counter at one end, choosing salads and starters, then move along to the hot food options. Next comes deserts, and then bread rolls and drinks are next to the pay desk. When you order the hot food, it’s weighed, and you pay per weight.

One of the reasons our students like Puzata hata is that it’s cheap. You can get a full meal for a couple of dollars.

The buffet style of Puzata Hata means that in one meal you can try lots of different Ukrainian food in Kyiv. Get a couple of Ukrainian salads – maybe an Olivier salad and a greek salad. Then some okroshka (cold soup) or borscht. Follow that with vereniki, Ukrainian dumplings.
