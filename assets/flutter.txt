Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It can be used to develop cross platform applications from a single codebase for the web,[4] Fuchsia, Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows.[5] First described in 2015,[6][7] Flutter was released in May 2017. Flutter is used internally by Google in apps such as Google Pay[8] and Google Earth[9] as well as by other software developers including ByteDance[10] and Alibaba.[11]

Flutter consists of both a UI language and a rendering engine. When a Flutter application is compiled, it ships with both the UI code and the rendering engine, which is about 4 MB compressed.[12] This is in contrast to many other UI frameworks that rely on a separate rendering engine and only ship the UI code, such as native Android apps which rely on the device-level Android SDK or HTML/JavaScript Web apps that rely on the user's HTML engine and JavaScript engine.[13][14] Flutter's complete control of its rendering pipeline makes supporting multiple platforms simpler as it only needs the platform to support running native code such as via the Android Java Native Interface rather than support Flutter's UI model in its entirety.
